# Gitmoji GitHub Action

A simple GitHub action that makes sure all commit messages are following the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) specification.

Note that, typically, you would make this check on a pre-commit hook (for example, using something like [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli)), but those can easily be skipped, hence this GitHub action.
